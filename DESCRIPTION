Description: This package implements and extends the phi
    statistic as measure of the strength of proportionality between two
    variables. This approach was proposed by Lovell et al.  (2015) in
    "Proportionality: A Valid Alternative to Correlation for Relative
    Data", DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075 for use with compositional
    data, i.e., data that carry only relative information (e.g.,
    proportions, percentages, parts-per-million, etc).
